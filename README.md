# 2023Spring---AVA-Robot-SDK

The SDK is meant to be used by the engineering students to be able to write simple Python programs and control the robot. There will be many different features to this so that anyone using the SDK will be able to control the robot, gain access to the camera, and/or get vital information regarding the overall health of the robot and location of the robot. The robot can be programmed using various programming languages, such as C++, Python, or Java, depending on the software stack used (we are using Python here). It can also be integrated with other systems, such as voice assistants or cloud-based services, to enhance its functionality, though we have not gotten that far yet.
